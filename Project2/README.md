## [Project 2. Predict Customer Churn in Python.](https://github.com/Dave10T/Dave-s-Data-Science-Portfolio-/tree/main/Project2)
   Predicting Customer Attrition Using Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms in Python
   
   **Project descrption:** Customer attrition (a.k.a customer churn) is one of the biggest expenditures of any organization. If one could figure out why a      customer leaves and when they leave with reasonable accuracy, it would immensely help the organization to strategize their retention initiatives manifold. We make     use of a customer transaction dataset from Kaggle to understand the key steps involved in predicting customer attrition in Python.
   Supervised Machine Learning is nothing but learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. A supervised machine learning    algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples. Given that we have data on current and prior     customer transactions in the telecom dataset, this is a standardized supervised classification problem that tries to predict a binary outcome (Y/N).
   
   ## Objectives of the project: To solve some of the key business challenges pertaining to customer attrition such as: 
    (1) what is the likelihood of an active customer leaving an organization? 
    (2) what are key indicators of a customer churn? 
    (3) what retention strategies can be implemented based on the results to diminish prospective customer churn?
    
   ## This project consists of the seven following stages: Section A: 
            Stage 1: Data Preprocessing
            Stage 2: Data Evaluation
            Stage 3: Model Selection
            Stage 4: Model Evaluation
            Stage 5: Model Improvement
            Stage 6: Future Predictions
            Stage 7: Model Deployment
