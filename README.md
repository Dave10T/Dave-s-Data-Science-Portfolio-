# The Dave's Tello Data Science Portfolio.
## This is a portfolio that contains the projects that I've been working on.
**Project description:** with an increase in the penetration of analytics into numerous facets of our lives, finance is definitely one of the earliest to catch onto this trend. In this project I have attempted to showcase how data analytics and visualization techniques can be incorporated in the world of cryptocurrencies.

### 1. Bitcoin aswell as other cryptocurrencies such as ETH, XRP, ADA and many others are the most profitable assets today

Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt explicabo. 


### 2. Understanding data & general statistics
For this analysis, I have used 6 years of historical data from around First-Jan 2015 to Nov-2021 of bitcoin. The data was taken from Yahoo Fianance. 
```Import necessary libraries â€”
   import numpy as np 
   import pandas as pd
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import seaborn as sns
   import datetime
   import warnings
   warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
```
